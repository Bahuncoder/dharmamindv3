      "acharya_commentary": "Adi Shankaracharya explains that Adhyasa is the fundamental error where we superimpose the properties of the body-mind complex upon the Atman, and vice versa. This mutual superimposition is the root cause of all suffering and bondage.",
      "philosophical_depth": "When one sees all beings in the Self alone, and the Self in all beings, then one does not feel hatred or aversion. This is only possible when the superimposition (adhyasa) of 'I' and 'mine' upon the body-mind is completely transcended through direct knowledge of Brahman.",

      "philosophical_depth": "Kaivalya represents the culmination of discriminative knowledge where consciousness (Purusha) recognizes its eternal separation from matter (Prakriti).
