Svetasvatara Upanishad
============================================================
Focus: Meditation techniques and cosmic vision


The Svetasvatara Upanishad gives detailed meditation instructions.

Meditation Posture and Practice (Chapter 2):
"Holding the body steady with the three parts erect (head, neck, torso),
drawing the senses and mind into the heart,
the wise one should cross over all the fearful currents by the raft of Brahman."

Breath Control:
"Restraining the breath and controlling the movements,
one should breathe through the nostrils with diminished breath.
The wise one should vigilantly control the mind,
as a charioteer controls unruly horses."

Meditation Environment:
"In a clean level place, free from pebbles, fire, and gravel,
favorable to thought by the sound of water and other features,
not offensive to the eye, sheltered from the wind,
there one should practice yoga."

Signs of Progress:
"Lightness, healthiness, steadiness, clearness of complexion,
pleasantness of voice, sweet odor, and slight excretions -
these, they say, are the first results of yoga's progress."

Cosmic Vision Meditation:
"You are the dark blue bee, the green parrot with red eyes,
the thunder cloud, the seasons, the seas.
You are without beginning, present everywhere.
From you all worlds are born."

Advanced Practice:
"As fire, though one, takes the shape of every object it consumes,
so the Self within all beings, though one, takes the form of every being.
Meditate on this unity."
