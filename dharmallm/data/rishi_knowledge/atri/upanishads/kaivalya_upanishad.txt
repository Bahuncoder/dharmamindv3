Kaivalya Upanishad
============================================================
Focus: Path to liberation through meditation


The Kaivalya Upanishad teaches direct path to liberation.

Meditation on the Self:
"Neither through work, nor through progeny, nor through wealth,
but through renunciation alone is immortality attained."

Technique - Withdrawal and Centering:
1. Withdraw senses from objects (Pratyahara)
2. Fix mind on the heart center
3. Recognize the Self dwelling within
4. Realize: "I am That" (So'ham)

The Inner Light:
"In the center of the body, in the lotus of the heart,
there shines the supreme light of consciousness.
Pure, changeless, eternal - meditate on That."

Mantra Meditation:
Use "So'ham" (I am That):
- Inhale: "So" (That)
- Exhale: "Ham" (I am)
- Realize unity with Brahman

Liberation Teaching:
"When all desires clinging to the heart fall away,
then the mortal becomes immortal.
When all knots of the heart are loosened,
even here in this body, one attains Brahman."

Final Instruction:
"Meditate on the Self as OM.
Cross the ocean of darkness by this sacred boat."
