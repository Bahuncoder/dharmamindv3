Isha Upanishad
============================================================
Focus: Seeing divine in all, renunciation in action


The Isha Upanishad teaches meditation through action and vision.

Opening Verse:
"ईशा वास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत्"
"The entire universe is pervaded by the Lord."

Meditation Practice - Seeing the Divine:
1. In every action, see the divine acting
2. In every object, see the divine manifested  
3. In every being, recognize the same Self
4. Remain unattached while fully engaged

Key Teaching:
"Into blinding darkness enter those who worship ignorance,
and into still greater darkness those who delight in knowledge alone."

Balance: Combine knowledge (jnana) with action (karma).
Meditate not by escaping the world, but by seeing the divine in it.

Liberation Formula:
- See unity in diversity
- Act without attachment
- Know the immortal in the mortal
- Transcend both knowledge and ignorance
