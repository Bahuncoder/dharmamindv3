Mandukya Upanishad
============================================================
Focus: Om meditation and consciousness states


The Mandukya Upanishad explores the sacred syllable OM and four states of consciousness.

OM - The Sacred Sound:
- A-kara: Waking state (Jagrat)
- U-kara: Dream state (Svapna)  
- M-kara: Deep sleep (Sushupti)
- Silence after: Turiya (Pure consciousness)

Key Teaching:
"The Self (Atman) is OM. This syllable is everything that was, is, and will be. 
All that transcends time is also OM."

Meditation Practice:
1. Chant OM slowly, feeling each component
2. Observe the silence after the sound
3. Rest in that silence - this is Turiya, pure awareness
4. All states arise and dissolve in this awareness
