Katha Upanishad
============================================================
Focus: Death, immortality, and inner journey


The Katha Upanishad teaches through the story of Nachiketa and Yama (Death).

Key Meditation Teaching:
"When the five senses are stilled, when the mind is stilled,
when the intellect is stilled - that is called the highest state.
This steady control of the senses is what is known as Yoga."

The Chariot Metaphor:
- Body = Chariot
- Soul = Passenger
- Intellect = Charioteer  
- Mind = Reins
- Senses = Horses
- Objects = Roads

Meditation: Control the mind (reins) to direct the senses (horses).
When the charioteer (intellect) is steady, the journey is smooth.

Path to Liberation:
"Beyond the senses is the mind, beyond mind is intellect,
beyond intellect is the great Self, beyond the Self is the Unmanifest.
Beyond the Unmanifest is Purusha, all-pervading and imperceptible.
Knowing Him, one attains liberation."
