VEDIC ASTROLOGY FUNDAMENTALS
From Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra
======================================================================


Jyotish - The Science of Light
------------------------------
Sanskrit: ज्योतिष
Vedic astrology (Jyotish) means 'science of light'. It reveals the karmic patterns written in the cosmic blueprint at birth.
Purpose: To understand one's dharma, karma, and life path through celestial influences


The Three Pillars
-----------------
  1_Rashi: The 12 zodiac signs representing different energies
  2_Graha: The 9 planets (including Rahu & Ketu) as karmic forces
  3_Bhava: The 12 houses representing life areas


Birth Chart (Kundali)
---------------------
Sanskrit: कुण्डली
The cosmic snapshot at the moment of birth, showing planetary positions in signs and houses
Significance: This chart is the map of one's karma from past lives and potential in this life


Ascendant (Lagna)
-----------------
Sanskrit: लग्न
The zodiac sign rising on the eastern horizon at birth
Importance: The Lagna represents the self, physical body, and life's overall direction


Core Teachings:
• The planets do not cause events; they indicate karmic patterns
• Free will exists within the framework of karma
• Jyotish is a tool for self-awareness, not fatalism
• Remedies can mitigate negative karma and enhance positive karma
