UNDERSTANDING YOUR CURRENT DASHA:
----------------------------------
Your birth Nakshatra determines which Dasha you start with.
The sequence then follows the order above.

Example: If born in Ashwini (ruled by Ketu), you start with
Ketu Dasha, then Venus, then Sun, and so on.


SUB-PERIODS (BHUKTI/ANTARDASHA):
---------------------------------
Each main period has sub-periods of all nine planets.
For example, during Venus Dasha:
• Venus-Venus (peak of Venus energy)
• Venus-Sun (mixing love with authority)
• Venus-Moon (emotional relationships)
...and so on


HOW TO USE DASHA KNOWLEDGE:
----------------------------
1. Know your current Maha Dasha (main period)
2. Understand that planet's nature and placement in your chart
3. The house that planet rules becomes active
4. Plan accordingly - don't fight the cosmic tide
5. Use remedies to maximize positive results


BHRIGU'S DASHA WISDOM:
----------------------
"Each Dasha brings its lesson. Saturn teaches patience,
Jupiter teaches wisdom, Venus teaches love. Accept each
period as a divine curriculum for your soul's evolution."


PRACTICAL EXAMPLE:
------------------
Person entering Saturn Dasha:
• Expect delays and hard work (Saturn's nature)
• Check Saturn's position in chart (which house?)
• If Saturn in 10th house: career requires extra effort
• Remedy: Serve the poor, practice discipline
• Result: Eventual success through perseverance


REMEDIES DURING DIFFICULT DASHAS:
----------------------------------
• Chant the planet's mantra
• Wear the planet's gemstone (after consultation)
• Perform charity related to that planet
• Observe fasts on planet's day
• Live dharmically - the best remedy
