BIRTH CHART INTERPRETATION - BHRIGU'S METHOD
========================================

Understanding the Kundali (Birth Chart)

STEP 1: Identify the Ascendant (Lagna)
---------------------------------------
The Ascendant is the zodiac sign rising on the eastern horizon at birth.
It represents:
• Your physical body and appearance
• Your basic nature and approach to life
• The lens through which you see the world
• Your life's overall direction

Example: If Aries is rising, you approach life with courage and directness.


STEP 2: Analyze the 12 Houses
------------------------------
Each house represents a life area:

1st House (Lagna): Self, body, personality, beginnings
2nd House: Wealth, family, speech, values
3rd House: Siblings, courage, short journeys, skills
4th House: Mother, home, emotions, vehicles, property
5th House: Children, creativity, intelligence, past life karma
6th House: Health, enemies, service, obstacles
7th House: Marriage, partnerships, business
8th House: Transformation, longevity, hidden matters, inheritance
9th House: Dharma, father, guru, fortune, long journeys
10th House: Career, status, authority, public image
11th House: Gains, friends, elder siblings, aspirations
12th House: Losses, liberation, foreign lands, spirituality


STEP 3: Locate Planetary Positions
-----------------------------------
Note which planet is in which house and sign.
Each planet brings its energy to that house.

Example: 
• Jupiter in 5th house = blessed with children and creativity
• Saturn in 7th house = delayed but stable marriage
• Moon in 4th house = emotional connection with mother


STEP 4: Check Planetary Strength
---------------------------------
Planets are stronger in certain positions:

Exaltation: Planet at peak power
Debilitation: Planet weakened
Own Sign: Planet comfortable
Friendly Sign: Planet supported
Enemy Sign: Planet challenged


STEP 5: Identify Yogas (Combinations)
--------------------------------------
Special planetary combinations create yogas:

Raja Yoga: Combinations for power and status
Dhana Yoga: Wealth-creating combinations
Vipareeta Raja Yoga: Success through adversity
Gajakesari Yoga: Jupiter-Moon combination for wisdom


STEP 6: Analyze Dashas (Time Periods)
--------------------------------------
Vimshottari Dasha shows which planet's period you're in.
Each planet activates its significations during its period.


BHRIGU'S INTERPRETATION PRINCIPLES:
-----------------------------------
1. Chart shows potential, not certainty
2. Free will operates within karmic framework
3. Remedies can modify outcomes
4. Dharmic living strengthens beneficial planets
5. Chart is a tool for self-awareness


INTERPRETATION EXAMPLE:
-----------------------
Birth Chart with:
• Leo Ascendant (Sun ruled)
• Sun in 10th house (career)
• Jupiter in 5th house (children)
• Saturn in 2nd house (wealth)

Reading: Natural leader (Leo rising), destined for public career 
(Sun in 10th), blessed with intelligent children (Jupiter in 5th), 
will earn wealth through discipline and hard work (Saturn in 2nd).


Bhrigu teaches: "The stars incline, they do not compel. 
Your karma is written, but your dharma can rewrite it."
