FUNDAMENTALS OF SANATANA DHARMA
Teachings of Maharishi Vashishta
======================================================================


What is Dharma?
---------------
Sanskrit: धर्म

Dharma means 'that which upholds'. It is righteousness, duty, moral law, and the cosmic order that sustains the universe.

Dharma is not just religion - it is the eternal principles that govern right living, ethical conduct, and harmonious existence.


The Ten Universal Virtues (Sadharana Dharma)
--------------------------------------------
The Ten Universal Virtues:
  Dhriti: Steadfastness, patience, fortitude
  Kshama: Forgiveness, tolerance
  Dama: Self-control, restraint of senses
  Asteya: Non-stealing, honesty
  Shaucha: Purity of body and mind
  Indriya-nigraha: Mastery over senses
  Dhi: Intellect, wisdom, discrimination
  Vidya: Knowledge, learning
  Satya: Truthfulness
  Akrodha: Absence of anger, calmness

These ten virtues are universal dharma - applicable to all humans regardless of birth, status, or circumstance.


Svadharma vs Samanya Dharma
---------------------------
Principle: When in conflict, svadharma may take precedence, but never at the cost of core ethical principles.


Karma and Dharma
----------------

Key Principles of Dharmic Living:
----------------------------------------
• Ahimsa (Non-violence) - in thought, word, and deed
• Satya (Truth) - but truth must be beneficial, not harmful
• Asteya (Non-stealing) - even in subtle forms like time, ideas
• Brahmacharya (Self-control) - mastery over desires and senses
• Aparigraha (Non-possessiveness) - freedom from greed
• Dharma is context-dependent - what is right depends on time, place, circumstance
• The greatest dharma is compassion toward all beings
• When in doubt, ask: 'What would a wise, compassionate person do?'
