THE FOUR PURUSHARTHAS - GOALS OF HUMAN LIFE
======================================================================


Dharma (धर्म)
--------------------------------------------------
Meaning: Righteousness, Duty, Ethics
Living according to moral law and cosmic order

Importance: Foundation for all other goals. Without dharma, other pursuits lead to suffering.

How to Pursue:
  • Study scriptures and learn ethical principles
  • Practice the ten universal virtues
  • Fulfill your duties according to your stage of life
  • Act with integrity in all situations
  • Serve others selflessly

Vashishta's Teaching: Dharma is not a burden but the path to true freedom. When you live righteously, the universe supports you.

Artha (अर्थ)
--------------------------------------------------
Meaning: Wealth, Material Prosperity, Security
Earning livelihood and creating material wellbeing through righteous means

Importance: Necessary for survival and supporting family. But must be earned ethically.

How to Pursue:
  • Develop skills and work diligently
  • Earn through honest means only
  • Save and invest wisely for future security
  • Share wealth through charity
  • Never sacrifice dharma for wealth

Vashishta's Teaching: Wealth earned through dharma brings peace; wealth earned through adharma brings anxiety. The truly wealthy person is content with enough.

Kama (काम)
--------------------------------------------------
Meaning: Desire, Pleasure, Enjoyment
Legitimate enjoyment of life's pleasures within dharmic boundaries

Importance: Life is meant to be enjoyed. Denying natural desires creates suppression. But enjoyment must be balanced.

How to Pursue:
  • Enjoy sensory pleasures without attachment
  • Practice moderation in all things
  • Respect boundaries of dharma in relationships
  • Appreciate beauty in nature, art, music
  • Cultivate refined tastes and aesthetic sense

Vashishta's Teaching: Pleasure pursued with awareness becomes a spiritual practice. Pleasure pursued with greed becomes bondage. The wise enjoy without being enslaved.

Moksha (मोक्ष)
--------------------------------------------------
Meaning: Liberation, Self-Realization, Freedom
Ultimate goal - freedom from the cycle of birth and death, union with the Divine

Importance: The highest aim. All other goals ultimately serve this purpose.

How to Pursue:
  • Practice meditation and self-inquiry
  • Study with a genuine guru
  • Renounce attachment (not things, but clinging)
  • Realize your true nature beyond body-mind
  • Live in awareness of the Divine in all

Vashishta's Teaching: Moksha is not somewhere to reach - it is what you already are. Remove ignorance, and liberation shines forth naturally.
