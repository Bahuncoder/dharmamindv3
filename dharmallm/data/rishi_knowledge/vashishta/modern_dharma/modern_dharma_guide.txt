FINAL TEACHING:
---------------
"Dharma in modern times is not different from ancient dharma -
the principles remain eternal. What changes is the context.

Drive your car with consideration for others - that's ahimsa.
Pay your taxes honestly - that's satya and asteya.
Use internet mindfully - that's self-control.
Recycle and save water - that's protecting dharma.

You don't need to go to a cave to live dharmically.
Your home is your ashram, your work is your karma yoga,
your family is your first congregation.

Live simply, think deeply, give generously, love unconditionally.
This is dharma in the 21st century."

- Maharishi Vashishta
