  "name": "Mundaka Upanishad",
  "text": "The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15), by Max Müller, [1879], at sacred-texts.com\n\nTHIS Upanishad has been so often edited and discussed that it calls for no special remarks. It forms part of the Satapatha-brâhmana. In the Mâdhyandina-sâkhâ of that Brâhmana, which has been edited by Professor Weber, the Upanishad, consisting of six adhyâyas, begins with the fourth adhyâya (or third prapâthaka) of the fourteenth book.\n\nThere is a commentary on the Brihadâranyaka-upanishad by Dvivedasrînârâyanasûnu Dvivedagaṅga, which has been carefully edited by Weber in his great edition of the Satapatha-brâhmana from a MS. in the Bodleian Library, formerly belonging to Dr. Mill, in which the Upanishad is called Mâdhyandinîya-brâhmana-upanishad.\n\nIn the Kânva-sâkhâ the Brihadâranyaka-upanishad forms the seventeenth book of the Satapatha-brâhmana, consisting of six adhyâyas.\n\nAs Saṅkara's commentary and the gloss of Ânandatîrtha, edited by Dr. Roer in the Bibliotheca Indica, follow the Kânva-sâkhâ, I have followed the same text in my translation.\n\nBesides Dr. Roer's edition of the text, commentary and gloss of this Upanishad, there is Poley's edition of the text. There is also a translation of it by Dr. Roer, with large extracts from Saṅkara's commentary.\n\np. xxxi\n\nNext: V: The Svetâsvatara-Upanishad\n\n\n\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism\n\n\n\n\n\n« Previous: The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15): Introduction: III: The Ta...\n\n\nIndex\n\n\nNext: The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15): Introduction: V: The Svet... »\n\nSacred Texts | \nHinduism",
