It has multiple meanings: (1) Righteousness and moral duty, (2) The cosmic law that maintains order, (3) One's personal duty based on their stage of life and position. The Bhagavad Gita teaches 'svadharma' - following one's own dharma is better than another's dharma well-performed. Dharma is what holds together society and the cosmos."

Its essence is captured in verse 2.47: 'कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन' - 'You have a right to perform your duty, but not to the fruits of action.' Key principles: (1) Perform your duty without attachment, (2) Don't be motivated by results, (3) Maintain equanimity in success and failure, (4) Offer all actions to the Divine. This transforms work into worship and liberates one from bondage."

Key teachings: (1) Atman is distinct from the body and mind, (2) It is identical with Brahman (the Absolute), (3) It is consciousness itself, (4) Realizing 'I am Atman' is liberation (moksha). The Chandogya Upanishad teaches 'Tat Tvam Asi' - 'That thou art' - affirming this identity."

Start with 5-10 minutes daily. The key sutra is 1.2: 'योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः' - Yoga is the cessation of mental modifications. Be patient and consistent."

Om has three parts: (1) A (अ) - waking state, creation, Brahma, (2) U (उ) - dream state, preservation, Vishnu, (3) M (म) - deep sleep, dissolution, Shiva. The silence after represents Turiya - the fourth state of pure consciousness. Chanting Om aligns us with cosmic vibrations."

It has two powers: (1) **Avarana Shakti**: Veiling power - hides the true nature of reality, (2) **Vikshepa Shakti**: Projecting power - projects the world of names and forms. Maya is neither real nor unreal - it's indescribable. Knowledge (jnana) of Brahman destroys Maya's effect."
