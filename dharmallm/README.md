## Installation

```bash
# Install from source
cd dharmallm
pip install -e .

# Or install with extras
pip install -e .[dev,gpu,enterprise]
```

## Quick Start

```python
from dharmallm import DharmaLLMTrainingEngine, DharmaLLMAdvancedConfig

# Create configuration
config = DharmaLLMAdvancedConfig.from_defaults()

# Initialize training engine
trainer = DharmaLLMTrainingEngine(config)

# Train model with dharmic principles
model = trainer.train()
```

## Configuration

DharmaLLM uses advanced configuration management:

```python
from dharmallm.config import DharmaLLMConfigFactory

# Create configuration for specific use case
config = DharmaLLMConfigFactory.create_config(
    model_size="7B",
    training_stage="dharmic_alignment",
    wisdom_tradition="universal"
)
```

## Command Line Interface

```bash
# Train a model
dharmallm-train --config configs/training.yaml

# Evaluate model performance
dharmallm-evaluate --model path/to/model --metrics wisdom,compassion

# Serve model
dharmallm-serve --model path/to/model --port 8080
```
