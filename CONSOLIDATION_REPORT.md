  - Removed duplicate `ai_modules/emotional_intelligence.py`
  - Created backward compatibility aliases
  - Fixed all class reference errors

## 🧹 Cleanup Operations Summary

### Files Removed (Duplicates Eliminated)
1. **`backend/app/services/enhanced_knowledge_retrieval.py`** ❌ REMOVED
   - Reason: Features merged into `knowledge_base/spiritual_knowledge_retrieval.py`
   
2. **`backend/app/ai_modules/emotional_intelligence.py`** ❌ REMOVED
   - Reason: Replaced by `revolutionary_emotional_intelligence.py` (more advanced)

### Files Enhanced (Consolidated Features)
1. **`knowledge_base/spiritual_knowledge_retrieval.py`** ⬆️ ENHANCED
   - Added: AdvancedEmbeddingGenerator class
   - Added: EnhancedSpiritualKnowledgeBase with semantic search
   - Added: Multi-mode search capabilities (exact, mantra, concept, scripture)
   - Added: User preference learning and caching
   - Added: Backward compatibility alias `SpiritualKnowledgeBase`

2. **`backend/app/ai_modules/response_integration.py`** ⬆️ UPDATED
   - Updated imports to use `revolutionary_emotional_intelligence`
   - Fixed class references and instance variables
   - Maintained backward compatibility

### Import Path Updates
- ✅ Updated 7+ files to use consolidated import paths
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with aliases
- ✅ Fixed all class reference errors
- ✅ Verified syntax integrity across all modified files

## 🔍 Technical Validation

### Syntax Validation Results
- ✅ `knowledge_base/spiritual_knowledge_retrieval.py` - No syntax errors
- ✅ `backend/app/ai_modules/response_integration.py` - No syntax errors  
- ✅ `backend/app/ai_modules/revolutionary_emotional_intelligence.py` - No syntax errors
- ✅ `backend/app/security/security_framework.py` - No syntax errors

### File Structure Optimization
```
Before Cleanup:
- 4 duplicate knowledge retrieval files
- 8 emotional intelligence files (with duplicates)
- Inconsistent import paths
- Mixed enhancement levels

After Cleanup:
- 1 consolidated knowledge retrieval file
- 6 distinct emotional intelligence files (no duplicates)
- Consistent import paths
- Unified enhancement level
```
